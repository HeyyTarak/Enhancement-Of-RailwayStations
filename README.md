# Enhancement-of-RailwayStations
 
Problem Statement: Enhancing Navigation for Railway Station Facilities
and Locations under the Theme of Transportation and Logistics.

Proposed Solution:
Our solution involves creating a dynamic web platform offering features
such as tailored station insights, city-specific station navigation, and
interactive geo-map exploration. This platform distinguishes itself by being
a unified information hub with immersive mapping and scalable growth
potential.
* City-wise station selection: Users can choose their city from a dropdown
menu.
 * Station-specific information: Detailed information about the selected
station, including address and map preview.
* Interactive map: A visually appealing and interactive map of the station,
displaying the location of various facilities like platforms, food stalls,
restrooms, ticket counters, waiting areas, etc.
 * Facility details: Upon clicking a facility icon on the map, users can access
detailed information such as items available, accepted payment methods,
discounts, and more.

Technology Stack:
• Frontend: HTML, Map Library, CSS
• Backend: Python, Django, Database, GeoJSON, Data Structures

Solution Representation:
We represent our solution through image snapshots, screen recordings,
and detailed flowcharts, providing both visual and process clarity.

Feasibility and Viability:
Potential challenges include:
• Precision and cohesion of data
• Mapping fidelity and granularity
• Intuitive usability challenges
• Seamless station integration

Mitigation Strategies:
• Deploying robust data cleaning and harmonization procedures
• Focusing on core insights and simplifying navigation guidance

Key Benefits:
• Streamlined operations
• Competitive edge through innovative mapping solutions

Research Sources:
We utilized resources like Google Search, Wikipedia, and Indianrail to
gather data and develop a robust solution.
